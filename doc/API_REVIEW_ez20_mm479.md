When discussing how we would create our front-end APIs, we discovered that we
were both going to use MVC's to structure the interactions between the front end
and the back end. One difference in how we planned on organizing our MVC was that
in ours, we would put observer notifications within the Model for the View to 
listen for, whereas their group planned on having the Model relay information back 
to the Controller, which would pass it to the View. For error handling, we were going to
have error messages show up in the history box, whereas their group would have a 
pop up message detailing the error. One great idea I took away from this conversation 
was that we could make our variable box more interactive. When a user created a 
user defined command, we could create a button within the variable box that would 
populate the command text area for easier use.
