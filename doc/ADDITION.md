* how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
	* I think that this will take 3 hours to complete this feature.
* how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
	* I will need to add a ScreenComponent subclass that represents the new view to be added to the GUI. In addition, I will need to add another Controller subclass because that is needed to act as a delegate for the new ScreenComponent class I just created. These two class additions were always going to be necessarily added with the requirement for a new View, as described in my SLOGO analysis/design.md. I also would need to add a few lines of code within the Workspace class to add the instantiation of the new Controller object I plan to create. I also need to add a bit of code to the GUI class to position the ScreenComponent subclass onto the main GUI. On top of these classes, I do need to modify the Model class in the backend because it wasnâ€™t designed well enough to handle actions on individual (not just active) turtles, so I would have to go back and modify code to account for that.
