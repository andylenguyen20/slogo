    # Estimation: before looking at the old code:
    
    * how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
        I anticipate this feature will take around 2 hours to complete. 
        
    * how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
        I will need to add another ScreenComponent, which would be the new front 
        end display showing the new feature. To connect this to the back end, I will
        need to also create another Controller class, which will be instantiated within
        the Workspace class. In addition, I will also need to slightly modify the GUI so
        it can position the new ScreenComponent, and I will need to add some additional methods to the
        Model class so that I can retrieve that the images of all the turtles.
