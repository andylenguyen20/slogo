* Estimation: before looking at the old code:
    * how long do you think it will take you to complete this new feature?
    
    I think it will take about an hour to complete this new feature. 
    * how many files will you need to add or update? Why?
    
    Two new command classes will need to be added, along with the
    appropriate information about them in the current properties file
    which tells the program how many children a given node has. Methods
    in Turtle and Model will need to be added as well, to add the turtle
    to the screen and keep track of 'stamped' turtles.
